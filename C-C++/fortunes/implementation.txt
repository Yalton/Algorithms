1. Create a Fortunes class with a constructor that takes in the size of the problem as a parameter.

2. Implement a public member function of the Fortunes class to run the algorithm, taking in the points as a parameter.

3. Implement a private member function of the Fortunes class to find the Voronoi diagram, using Fortune's algorithm.

4. Implement a private member function of the Fortunes class to find the Delaunay triangulation, using the Law of Cosines.

5. Implement a private member function of the Fortunes class to check if there is a valid Delaunay triangulation, returning a boolean value.
